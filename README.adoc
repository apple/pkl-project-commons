= Pkl Project Commons

This repository houses libraries that are implementation details for the Pkl project.

These libraries are not meant for general use.

== Publishing packages

To publish a package, run `./scripts/publish_package.sh` with the name of the package.

For example:

[source,bash]
----
./scripts/publish_package.sh pkl.impl.ghactions
----

== Updating `pkl.impl.ghactions`

There is a script in `./scripts/update_downstream_ci.sh` that auto-bumps the `pkl.impl.ghactions` package in every downstream repository.

This script should be run whenever a new package is published.
